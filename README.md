Firestore-Vue Reactive Library using Composition API
====================================================

A library to help with linking Vue controls to Firestore documents/queries using
Vue Composition API style `ref` and `computed` style observables.

Created out of using [`vuefire`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuefire) but after experiencing some 
difficulties integrating it into new Typescript based composition components.

This is in use and workable, but is very much still at an early alpha state in terms of general use.
